*A repository for tutorials on the MOVES EPA software for precise emissions estimation.*

In 2023, the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) at Cornell University is hosting several webinars, aimed at providing tools and training for the next generation of decisionmakers and transportation engineers for enacting green transportation strategies. This repository will host CTECH's webinar/workshop materials for those trainings, which tend to focus on *MOVES*, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s state-of-the-art software for estimating emissions from transportation at extremely granular levels.
