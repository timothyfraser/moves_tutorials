*A repository for tutorials on the MOVES EPA software for precise emissions estimation.*

In 2023, the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health (CTECH) at Cornell University is hosting several webinars, aimed at providing tools and training for the next generation of decisionmakers and transportation engineers for enacting green transportation strategies. This repository will host CTECH's webinar/workshop materials for those trainings, which tend to focus on *MOVES*, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s state-of-the-art software for estimating emissions from transportation at extremely granular levels.

## Webinar 1: Using MOVES for County Emissions Estimation

- Abstract: The EPAâ€™s MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) is a major tool for modeling emissions from transportation at the national, county, and project level for criteria air pollutants and greenhouse gases. In this talk, Dr. Tim Fraser will introduce the basic usage and workflow of the MOVES software on a windows computer, including querying and post-processing MOVES outputs post-analysis in R. This talk aims to serve as an introduction to new potential MOVES users, including policy practitioners, researchers, and graduate students.
